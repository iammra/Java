******************************    Understanding the JRE System Library in Eclipse IDE   ************************************
                                  ===================================================

JRE System Library is added by Eclipse IDE automatically on creating Java Projects. JRE System Library implements the Java API in 
Eclipse IDE. So all the predefined functions of Java, can be accessed by the Java Programs written in Eclipse IDE because of this 
JRE System Library.

We can create programs in different programming language in Eclipse IDE. In case,when you want to create Python Programs in Eclipse 
IDE, you need to find the Library files of Python language and import them into Eclipse IDE before creating them. In this case, the 
Library files of Python Language can be called as External Library.


What are .jar Files ?
====================

JAR means Java ARchive.
So JAR files are fundamentally archive files, build on ZIP file format, typically used to collect many Java Class files and have the 
.jar file extension.

So in order to use the Classes of Java containing predefined functions, all the Classes of Java are grouped into .jar files. And all 
the .jar files of Java are collected in one library i.e. JRE System Library. When any Java Project in Eclipse IDE uses this JRE System 
Library, it will have access to all the predefined function of Java.
